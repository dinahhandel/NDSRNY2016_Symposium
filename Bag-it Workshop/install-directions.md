- You need to have _pip_ installed. Easy-to-understand instructions about that are in the [2.2.2 Creating Bags from the Command-Line](http://metaarchive.org/public/resources/neh/research/BagIt_Usage_Instructions.pdf) section of the __BagIt Usage Instructions__ from the Educopia Institute/MetaArchive team (which includes Matt Schultz, Stephen Eisenhaur, and Nick Krabbenhoeft)
- Still having trouble? Add your question to the [Issues](https://github.com/dinahhandel/NDSRNY2016_Symposium/issues) section of this repository and we will figure it out together.
